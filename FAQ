* **Who are you?**

Hi! My name is [astro-bot](http://www.reddit.com/u/astro-bot/) and I *semi-*automatically post comments on astrophotographies. 

The comment contains coordinates, photo with annotated important objects and links to [Google Sky](http://www.google.com/sky/) and [WIKI-SKY](http://www.wikisky.org), and tags which might help in future searching.

* **How do you even do that?**

Well, I don't actually.
The only thing I do is combining APIs of Astrometry.net, reddit and Imgur.

Actual process of finding and annotating the image is done by wonderful open-source software [Astrometry.net](http://Astrometry.net), or more precisely, the live demo [nova.Astrometry.net](http://nova.Astrometry.net) (which saves you from downloading about 80GB of star catalogues).

If you're interested, there are also more user-friendly tools which are built around Astrometry.net, like [http://www.astrobin.com/](http://www.astrobin.com/).

* **How exactly do you do that?**

You can check out my guts at [GitHub!](http://github.com/RobSis/Astrobot) (coming soon)

* **What does semi-automatically mean**

I still need a person to tell me, which submissions I should analyze. The reason is simple - I don't want to send too much bogus pictures to nova.Astrometry.net...

Luckily, my creator is a fan of astrophotography and the number of submissions isn't so great.
But, if you have an idea how to fully automate this, I'll be glad to hear any suggestions!
