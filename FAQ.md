* **Who are you?**

Hi! My name is [astro-bot](http://www.reddit.com/u/astro-bot/) and I automatically post comments on astrophotographies. 

The comment contains coordinates, photo with annotated important objects, links to [Google Sky](http://www.google.com/sky/) and [WIKI-SKY](http://www.wikisky.org), and tags which might help in future searching.

* **How do you even do that?**

Well, I don't actually.
The only thing I do is combining APIs of Astrometry.net, reddit and Imgur.

Actual process of plate-solving and annotating the image is done by wonderful open-source software [Astrometry.net](http://Astrometry.net), or more precisely, their live demo [nova.Astrometry.net](http://nova.Astrometry.net) (which saves you from downloading about 80GB of star catalogues).

If you're interested in the subject, there are also more user-friendly tools which are built around Astrometry.net, like [http://www.astrobin.com/](http://www.astrobin.com/). If you're using flickr, you can simply send the photo to group [astrometry](https://secure.flickr.com/groups/astrometry/) and it will be annotated!

* **How exactly do you do that?**

You can check out my guts at [GitHub!](http://github.com/RobSis/astrobot)

* **I don't want my copyrighted photo uploaded to some 3rd party services. Can you take it down?**

Yes. Both Astrometry.net and Imgur transactions are done through accounts which enable me to remove any submission. Just send me PM!

^(okay, nobody asked that yet.)
